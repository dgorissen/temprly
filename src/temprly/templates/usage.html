<h3>Thank you for registering with Temprly!</h3>

As explained in the <a href="https://github.com/dgorissen/temprly/blob/master/README.rst">Github Readme</a> this is a working prototype
site but still needs lots of love.  Especially visually.  So dont be shy :)

<p />

To start submitting sensor readings simply POST to the following URL from your sensor/device:

<ul>	
<li>http://www.temprly.com/temprly/readings/add/[location_name]/sensor_name/value?token={{token}}</li>
</ul>

Where value is the numeric sensor reading and the location name is optional.  The location and sensor will be created
if they do not already exist.
<p />
<em></>Please keep your token private and do not use Temprly for sensitive data!</em>
